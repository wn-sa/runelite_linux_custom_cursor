# Linux Custom Cursor
Java has an issue where all cursors are restricted to 2 colors at most. Any cursors are flattened to 2 colors making 
them appear flat and ugly. This plugin circumvents that by displaying an image at the location of the cursor while 
making the cursor transparent. It technically works on all platforms, but other platforms probably don't need it.

There will be a small delay between the image rendering and the actual "cursor" movement. 
This delay is pretty unnoticeable in my testing, however.

### Setting a Custom Cursor
Place a file called "cursor.png" into ~/.runelite on OSX/Linux or into %userprofile%\.runelite\ on Windows. This file 
will be used when "Custom Cursor" is selected in the plugin.

### Extra Cursors
All the cursors provided by the default custom cursor plugin are included. A number of additional pre-made cursors
are also included and the custom cursor/equipped weapon features from the original are also implemented.

* 24-Carat Sword
* Abyssal Dagger (p)
* Armadyl Godsword
* Blade of Saeldor (c)
* Bruma Torch
* Colossal Blade
* Cursed Banana
* Dragon Defender
* Dragon Halberd
* Dragon Hunter Lance
* Emberlight
* Gilded Scimitar
* Gilded Spade
* Ham Joint
* Hunting Knife
* Keris Partisan
* Lobster
* Osmumten's Fang
* Red Chinchompa
* Rubber Chicken
* Salmon
* Stale Baguette
* Tecu Salamander
* Thunder Khopesh
* Toktz-Xil-Ek
* Voidwaker

### Cursor Calibration
Cursors are generally a square image such as 24x24 with the "click spot" offset by around 10px/5px 
in the horizontal/vertical directions respectively. Unfortunately, it's not really possible (as far as I know) to get 
this information dynamically from Java, so the user will have to edit it themselves.

![Settings](src/main/resources/general-settings-readme.png)
* Cursor: Your chosen cursor to display instead of the default.
* Mirror Cursor Horizontally/Vertically: Mirrors the chosen image horizontally or vertically. Useful for the "equipped weapon" option which may not always point in the right direction.
* Cursor Size Scaling: Makes your cursor larger or smaller by the chosen number. For example, a value of 2 would make the cursor 2x as large and 0.5 would be half as large.
* System Cursor Width/Height: Get this from your system settings. It is almost 100% certainly a square shape. If you are uncertain, just increase/decrease them simultaneously until the click spot matches.
* Cursor Hotspot X Offset: how far to the right from the top-left of the image should the click spot be. This number is usually around 10 pixels on a 24x24 cursor.
* Cursor Hotspot Y Offset: how far down from the top-left of the image the click spot should be. This number is usually around 5 pixels on a 24x24 cursor.

### Debug Settings
* As of now, just one option to also render the normal system cursor at the same time. This can be useful to help adjust the hotspot.

# Changelog
#### 1.3
* Updated to support RuneLite's PluginDependency changes
#### 1.2
* Modified behavior to disable the overlay when the drag hotkey (default is left alt, set in the 'RuneLite' settings) 
is pressed. There was a report that the plugin was interfering with the ability
to move UI elements around, so I am adding this as a fix.
#### 1.1.1
* Hopefully finally fixed performance dropping off a cliff after extended periods of play
#### 1.1
* Dragon Scimitar icon was loading in strangely. It was being pulled from the default RuneLite resources, but in the interest of time a new .png was provided to fix it
* Several new cursors have been added. See the relevant section of the readme for the new options.
#### 1.0.6
* Added a scale feature to scale cursor size. Cursors could be unusable if your UI scaling is not 1x.
#### 1.0.5
* Huge thanks to GitHub user 'rcnoob' for reminding me this plugin exists by fixing a massive memory leak that would eventually tank performance by caching images and flushing them properly.
* Added a feature to mirror a cursor vertically/horizontally. Many more items can now be used as cursors.
#### 1.0.4
* Fixed a bug where logging out would keep your cursor invisible. Cursor should now properly reset until logged back in.
#### 1.0.3
* Cursor was getting moved when other overlays were active. Adjusted the image to be "dynamic" so its location is independent of other overlays.
  * This could mean your hotspot adjustment will change quite a bit. Recalibration likely needed by the user.
* Removed some unused code
#### 1.0.1/1.0.2
* I failed at getting the formatting correct to submit this plugin to RuneLite. Just updating version numbers, gradle config and cleaning up formatting.
